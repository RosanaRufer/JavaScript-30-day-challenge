# JavaScript-30-day-challenge
I am following this fun challenge by Wes Bos.

# Coolest part of each JS30 day

## Day 1

## Day 2

## Day 3 - CSS Variables

* `:root` is the document's root element, the `<html></html>`, and is where we define CSS variables.

* A CSS variable is defined as: `--<varName>: <value><unit>`

* We can set a CSS variable **from JavaScript** using: `document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--<variableName>', '<value>')`

* **Improvement:** We can use the HTML `onInput` attribute for detecting changes on the `<input>` element. For example when moving the 'range' bar or changing  the 'color' when it's color type.

* The `filter` CSS property applied to an image is very cool, we used it together with the `blur` function.

## Day 4 - Array Cardio Day 1

* Just exercises on array prototype methods: `filter`, `map`, `sort`, 

* We also remember the fact we can't use these methods after using a `document.querySelector` or document.querySelectAll, because they return a NodeList. We convert it using Array.from(NodeList) or using the ES6 spread as: [...NodeList]

* Mind blow when seeing `console.table()`  ðŸ’¥ ðŸ’¥ ðŸ’¥

* JavaScript Array `reduce` method is also very cool and I like the syntax a lot. `array.reduce( function(obj,next), <initial value>)`;

## Day 5 - Flex Panel Gallery

* Wes Bos has another series with only flexbox exercises and that's gonna be my next entertainment after I end this one.

* Remember: (I already knew this but just for the record) We apply the `display: flex;` attribute in the container of our template in order to use flexbox. This will make the child elements to display inline with a width as big as their content. Later, we tell each child which fraction of the remaining space they should take.

* Justify content: aligns a flexible container in the X-Axis, align-items: same but in the Y-Axis, also in a flexible container.

* `>` Selects immediate children. These are called CSS **Combinators** || Asterisk selector: selects all elements.

## Day 6 - Type Ahead

* `fetch` function itself returns a promise. When using `then` it returns a **blob** of data.

* The blob has to be converted from the raw data into JSON, we use for that the `blob.json()` **async** method.

* Again, we use the ES6 spread operator to spread or expand an array into multiple arguments to the push method.

* Using .join() to convert an array of `<li>` elements into an HTML string. The argument of the `join` function is the string character we may want to add in between the HTML elements.

## Day 7 - Array Cardio Day 2

* Playing with `some` and `every`. Very simple this day.

* Be careful with date prototype getYear function and use **getFullYear** instead.

* You can see the name and value of a boolean in the console by writing it as console.log({variableName})

* `splice(index, n, a1, a2...)` method removes n elements starting at index and adds a<sub>n</sub> elements.

* `slice(start, endNotIncluded)` returns  from start to end, end not included.

## Day 8 -

* To start drawing on a canvas, first get the context. It could be 2D or 3D.
